	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, especially in the analysis and design of algorithms. An algorithm is said to be efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can solve problems quickly even as the size of the input grows. Understanding the time complexity of an algorithm is crucial for writing efficient code, as it allows developers to predict how the algorithm will perform as the input size increases. By choosing algorithms with low time complexity, developers can ensure that their programs run efficiently, even on large datasets.</p>

		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis, along with time complexity. <b>Space Complexity</b> is typically expressed using Big O notation, just like time complexity. For example, an algorithm with a <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means that the amount of memory space it requires is proportional to the size of the input. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is important for writing memory-efficient code, especially in scenarios where memory is limited or needs to be optimized.
