	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an 
		algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.  
		An algorithm is said to be efficient it can solve problems
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by 
		an algorithm to solve a problem as a function o 
		alongof O(n) means that the amount of memomited or needs to be optimized.
